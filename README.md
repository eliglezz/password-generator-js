# password-generator-js
This was another homework assignment, 
the goal was to get the password generator to work from the code provided.
The code consist of a function which prompts the user to choose a length, then different criteria of what should be included in their password.
The function uses a long line of if else statements to ask for said criteria to then return a concatenation of the arrays chosen. 
These said statements were probably the most time consuming. Followed by the getting them to actually work. 
I also struggled with the organization but finally added a few notes to keep me on track.
